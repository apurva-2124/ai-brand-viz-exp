            AI search doesn't use the same ranking signals as traditional SEO. 
            For brands that rely on SEO & paid search for discovery, AI-generated responses may not surface them the same way Google rankings do.

              <span>Examples of brands that lost visibility in AI search despite ranking high on Google:</span>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-10 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Airtable</strong>: Ranks well in Google for productivity and database tool searches, but AI responses typically mention it as a secondary option after more prominent names like Notion or Monday.com.</li>
              <li><strong>Vrbo</strong>: Has strong Google search rankings for vacation rentals (often appearing in top 3 results), but is frequently overshadowed by Airbnb in AI responses, leading to lower AI visibility.</li>
              <li><strong>Scott's Cheap Flights</strong>: Has strong Google rankings for flight deals searches but moderate AI visibility, as AI mentions it along competitor newsletters and doesn't recommend it directly.</li>

          <p className="text-lg mt-8">
            Even brands that appear in AI search may not be explicitly recommended in AI search. Instead of clear endorsements, AI often presents them alongside competitors in an undifferentiated way or with negative sentiment.

              <li><strong>Roman (Ro Health)</strong>: Has high visibility in AI responses but is often presented as one option among many without explicit recommendation, especially when compared to competitors like Hims.</li>
